# Material Management System (MMS) - Structural Steel Installation

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the Material Management System (MMS) used in the construction of a medical research facility located at 10300 Campus Point Drive, near Torrey Pines. The structural steel scope of work is subcontracted by DPR Construction to Henrick.

## Project Details
- **Project Name:** Material Management System - Structural Steel Installation
- **Project Location:** 10300 Campus Point Drive, Torrey Pines
- **General Contractor:** DPR Construction
- **Subcontractor:** Henrick (Structural Steel)
- **Building Size:** 800,000 sq. ft.
- **Building Features:** 7 stories, 2 subgrade parking and mechanical floors, 5 above-grade floors
- **Main Components:** Steel columns, beams, metal decking, reinforcing steel rebar

## Operation Process
1. **Steel Columns Placement** – Two floors worth of columns placed.
2. **Steel Beams Connection** – Beams connected via bolts.
3. **Metal Decking Placement** – Decking placed on the floor.
4. **Reinforcing Steel Rebar Placement** – Installed on the metal decking.
5. **Crane Relocation** – Crane moves to the next point around the building.
6. **Repeat Steps 2-5** until floor structure is complete.
7. **Inspection & Adjustment** – Ensure plumbness, alignment, and welding of components.
8. **Repeat Process** until the entire building’s structural steel core is complete.

## Material Management System
### **Ordering & Delivery**
- Structural steel components ordered **6 months** in advance.
- Commodity materials (e.g., bolts, clamps) ordered as needed (3-4 business days lead time).
- Daily material deliveries aligned with the required daily work volume.

### **Storage & Handling**
- Materials stored in designated layout areas for efficient access.
- **Pre-organized bundles** arranged in installation order.
- Commodity materials stored directly at the worksite for immediate use.
- Materials are labeled with **QR codes and numeric identifiers** for easy retrieval.

### **Quality Control & Inspection**
- **Delivery Inspection** – Quality checks at the steel mill before delivery.
- **Laydown Area Inspection** – Verification of materials before installation.
- **Installation Inspection** – Ensuring alignment, clearances, and correct fastening.

## Performance Analysis
- **Steel erection cycle time:** ~7 minutes 91 seconds per cycle.
- **Labor Utilization:** Crew 1 and Crew 2 sequentially handle steel members, while Crew 3 and Crew 4 assist in detachment and preparation.
- **Material Handling Efficiency:** Material retrieval streamlined using QR codes and sequential storage.

## Recommendations for Improvement
1. **Crew Consolidation** – Merge the steel, rebar, and decking crews to improve efficiency and reduce labor costs.
2. **Material Staging Optimization** – Store materials closer to installation points or directly on delivery trucks to minimize handling.
3. **Increase System Responsiveness** – Improve adaptability to design changes by refining procurement flexibility.

By implementing these recommendations, the Material Management System can enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve overall project success.
